 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
____________________________

Q. What does "Rebuild Archive" actually do?

A. When you delete a file from an archive, it's only getting deleted
from the file list. This makes it totally invisible to everything that
can read GTA IMG archives but the actual file still exists inside the
IMG file. When you rebuild the archive, IMG Tool removes any
"invisible files" in the IMG file. So basicly it saves harddrive space.


Q. Will you teach me how to make textures/models?

A. No. I'm not good with graphics :). A good place to get help would
be GTAForums.com in the graphics or editing forums.


Q. I've found a bug! What should I do?

A. Post details at www.GTAForums.com - Please include your system
specs and operating system.


Q. I've deleted a file from an archive without backing up, can you send
me the original?

A. No! Didn't you see the warning?! You'll have to reinstall to get the
originals back. Pay more attention to warnings in future.
